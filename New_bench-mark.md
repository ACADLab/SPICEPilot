### **Hard Level (25-45 Transistors)**

**Description:** An 8-bit shift register is a sequence of eight D flip-flops connected in series. Each flip-flop shifts a data bit to the next one on each clock pulse, moving data from the input to the output bit-by-bit. This arrangement allows for serial data transfer and storage, controlled by a common clock signal.


2. 4-bit Synchronous Binary Counter in CMOS

**Description**: This 4-bit synchronous binary counter uses D-type flip-flops and CMOS-based logic gates to create a counter that progresses in a binary sequence. The design is synchronous, meaning that all flip-flops receive a common clock signal, ensuring simultaneous updates and eliminating ripple delays typically found in asynchronous designs. Each of the four flip-flops (FF0 to FF3) represents one bit of the counter's output, moving from the least significant bit to the most significant. The first flip-flop (FF0) toggles on each clock pulse, while the subsequent flip-flops toggle based on the outputs of preceding flip-flops, managed by additional logic gates. 

The input for each flip-flop, D0 to D3, is set based on an AND gate arrangement: FF0 toggles on each clock pulse; FF1 toggles when FF0 is high; FF2 toggles when both FF0 and FF1 are high, and FF3 toggles when FF0, FF1, and FF2 are high. To achieve the AND gate functionality in CMOS, a combination of NAND gates and inverters is used, creating robust synchronous control. Outputs from each flip-flop—Q0, Q1, Q2, and Q3—form the counter’s 4-bit binary output, counting sequentially from 0 to 15. This CMOS-based 4-bit counter is compact and efficient, demonstrating stable synchronous counting suitable for digital applications.

4. Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) Circuit in MOSFET Technology

**Description**: This Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) circuit synchronizes an output oscillator with an external reference signal, achieving phase alignment and frequency control. It consists of three key components: a phase detector, a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), and a loop filter, all implemented using MOSFET technology for precise control and stability.

The phase detector compares the phase of the input reference signal with the output of the VCO. Any phase difference generates an error signal, which indicates whether the VCO should speed up or slow down. This error signal then passes through a loop filter, which smooths out rapid changes, generating a stable control voltage for the VCO. The voltage-controlled oscillator adjusts its frequency based on this control voltage, gradually aligning its phase with the reference signal. 

In this MOSFET-based design, each component is optimized for integration and low-power operation. The phase detector uses MOSFETs configured to produce an accurate and fast response to phase differences. The loop filter, also realized with MOSFETs, ensures a stable and low-noise control voltage, while the VCO adjusts the output frequency in response to minor fluctuations in the control voltage, thereby locking onto the reference signal. This PLL circuit provides reliable phase synchronization suitable for applications in communication systems, frequency synthesis, and signal processing.
